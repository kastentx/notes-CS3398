## Risk Analysis
* engineering estimates are typically _optimistic_
  * don't always account for sick time, other issues that pop up
* anaylsis helps to create a realistic project size.. prepare for risks
  * first, identify and analyze all the possible risks
  * get a probability for each of these risks
  * weigh them according to how big the consequences are if they happen

* strategy is developed to handle the situation (if they happen)
* this way, the team is ready if the problems occur

* often referred to as development or engineering managers
* they work closesly with
  * product manager

  * dev teams

### Engineering Managers
* needs to understand people, but also something about the tech
  * the best managers have skill in both areas
* can lead anywhere from 4 to 20 people
* good managers will have regular, frequent one-on-one meetings with each team member

## Teamwork
