# Quiz #2 Review
* Problem 6: user requirements

# Software Requirements Specification
## IEEE template
* we _can_ use it, but we don't _have_ to
* don't have to fill out all the sections
  * only important/relevant ones
* rules and stuff will go in section 2.1/2.2
* since prof is customer.. there won't be anything to put in section 2.5
* section 3 will be a description of the interface (graphics, buttons)
  * probably won't have anything for section 3.4
* the meat of the doc will be in section 4
* since IEEE doc is in .doc format, copy/paste the text into a .txt or .md format

# Design Patterns
* Created by the Gang of Four
  * Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vissides
* based on realization that there are common solutions to common problems
* attempts to prevent users from "reinventing the wheel"
* emphasis on **interfaces**

## Interface vs. Inheritence
* `Inheritance`: closely ties the subclass to the superclass
* `Interface`: looser coupling or client
  * easier to swap things out

## File Access example
* imagine an app that reads a file
* several different classes all need to access the file
* collisions possible
* poor performance from opening and closing file multiple times
* lots of changes (in each class) needed if filename is changed
* Solution?
  * wrap the file in a fileAccessor class
  * use `static` keyword
    * file opens when app does, and doesn't close until app does
  * using an instance of a class that was created _statically_ but accesses the file _dynamically_
    * This is the **Singleton Pattern**
      * by using a private constructor and a public `getInstance()` method you can be sure that there is only ever one instance of an object
      * useful for database accessors, printers, graphics hardware
      * very common pattern... often found inside other patterns

## Candy Bars example
* need to go to the store and get candy bars
* won't know which ones to get until we get to store
* will need to write a separate function for each type of candy
  * client code needs to know details about each candy bar (which type of object)
* Solution?
  * cascading if() statement
    * easy implementation, client code only needs to pass in a string
    * BUT you can't have multiple return types... no need to make a superclass really
  * use CandyBar interface
    * this way only needs one class instance
  * use the **Factory Pattern**
    * for a more specific circumstance that occurs often
      * when the client has many variant implementations of a common interface
      * when the client expects more implementations of an interface to be added in the future
    * also a very common pattern
  * also look at **Factory Method**
    * still need to create a new() instance of each factory

### Dependency Injection
* allows us to get around the challenges of Factory Method
* enables quick swapping of test/mock implementations of many different classes

### Quiz prep
* ABSTRACT FACTORY PATTERN (factory of factories)
