# More Design Patterns

## Bicycle Problem
* bicycles have many components
  * some of these might be optional
* constructor could be very complex
  * will need extra constructors for optional components

### Possible Solutions
1. move all constructors to methods that live on the object
  * however... this allows us to create a Bicycle w/ no parts
2. create a new class (with interface) that caan set the components, then create new Bicycle when ready
  * you can chain the different methods that add components, and make 1 call to .build()
  * this is the `Builder Pattern`

## Container Problem
* what if you need to give out candy bars, but don't know what type of container they'll be in

### Solution
1. use forEach, which leverages the `Iterator` interface
  * forEach + iterators can cause some issues with multi-threaded applications

## Lots of CandyBars problem
* family doesn't want to wait in line for candyBars
* they expect to have their names called when we are ready to hand them a specific candyBar type
* how to notify them when we are ready to give them a specific candyBar?

### Solution
1. could go room to room and hand out the candy bars
  * inefficient, and would require us to know the locations of each kid
2. have each person register which type of candy bar they want?
  * this is the `Observer` pattern
    * implement the `Observable` and `Observer` interfaces
    * uses the `addObserver()` method and and `update()` and the `notifyObservers()` method

## Commuting Problem
* commuting from austin
* might take different methods of transportation (car, bus, other car, etc)

### Solution
* use the `Strategy` pattern!
  * each method of transportation can use a `getMeToClass()` method
  * lets us choose an algorithm at runtime (can be used to select other things too) without knowing the details of the strategy implementation
  * when used with _Dependency Injection_ we can easily switch between strategies

## Using Old Implementations
* we need to call some old code that doesn't implement the interface we use with the new code
* want to leverage the old code functionality without breaking our ability to use Dependency Injection
  * this is a case for the `Adapter Pattern`
    * uses a new class (adapter) that contains the old code as a member
    * new class also implements new interface
    * `doNewThing()` method implements the old method
