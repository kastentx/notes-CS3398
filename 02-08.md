# notes on reviewed SRS's
* the word `shall` should be used for **requirements**
  * this is how the **test plan** ties to the SRS

# Chapter 8 + Testing

## Unit Testing
* writing a test at the level of code
* tests designed to handle details of the class and functions
* tests live with the code
* as code changes, tests will break and have to be rewritten
* you should write tests that you expect to pass and those that should fail
* _mock objects_ can be created if you need to test objects or state that can't be created automatically by testrunner

### Unit Testing in IntelliJ
* IDE has built in features to generate code for unit tests
* `Assert` and `Test` packages from JUnit4 are used
* the test runner will only run stuff annotated with `@Test`


## TDD: Test Driven Development
* advanced agile practice
* start by writing all your tests 
  * they will fail... then write code to make them pass one by one

## Positive/Negative Testing
* Positive (Happy Path) tests consider typical user scenarios
* Negative tests consider unexpected scenarios
  * failed DBs, bad network, garbage input, etc.
* Edge Case tests consider unlikely but plausible input
  * really small/large numbers, etc.

## Integration (Component) Testing
* Testing the interfaces of components, or the interaction between two or more components
  * two different classes, a class and a DB, etc.
* requires knowledge of the interfaces but not the underlying code

## Behavior Driven Development
* Takes the concept of Test Driven Development to the next level
* often requires extra tooling
* uses a feature based language:
  * `given`
  * `when`
  * `then`

## System Testing
* High level integration testing performed by development
* helps ensure that release testing goes smoothly

## Release Testing

### Smoke Testing
* quick round of testing during each release
* tests typical expected scenarios
* failures mean immediate release failure, and rollback

### White Box Testing
* High level tests with a detailed understanding of underlying code
* tests will stress known, or potential weaknesses in the system
* may include negative tests

### Black Box testing
* testing performed without any knowledge of the code or internal structure
* tests are designed to handle typical use cases

### UI Testing
* For applications with User Interfaces (especially web apps)
* tests all the UI components
* tests the different user flows

## User Testing
* Alpha Testing: end users work closely with the dev team to test system
  * very early release version of the software
  * often these are performed on-site with devs
* Beta Testing: end users are given more freedom to test under normal scenarios
  * tests are typically performed on customer premises
  * software is typically still unfinished
* Acceptance Testing: final testing round before product is relesed to production
  * known as going 'gold'
  * stressful, all hands on deck round of tests

# Questions for next time (Assignment 8)
* negative testing important because of the "unknown unknowns"
*
