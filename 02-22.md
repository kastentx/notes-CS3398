# Test Review
* test is less likely to have questions taken straight from book.
* most questions will be reworded at least
* be ready to write Unit Tests (JUnit)
* be ready to draw UML diagrams
* test won't have questions about the famous computer scientists

## assignment 1
* professional software include developed programs, documentation, support, etc.
* know the different roles on team, Tester, QA, etc..
* know different types of applications, and why you would need each
* know differnt types of confidential customer information

## assignment 2
* don't worry too much about user requirements vs. system requirements
* process maturity - what is CMMi?
* why is waterfall less popular now? <-- _more than one question based on this_
  * too slow to get a deliverable
  * hard to handle changing requirements
  * OOP + modularized code have changed the way programs are developed
* **Verification:** does it work the way it's supposed to? (according to its design)
* **Validation:** is the design correct? (is it this the correct thing)
* understand why prototypes are useful... and what they might be used for
* know the phases of Waterfall

## assignment 3
* Functional vs. non-Functional requirements - know the difference
* understand use cases... may need a UML diagram for this (shows up on SRS)
* state diagram would also show up on SRS
* what is purpose of SRS?
  * testing requirements
  * contract between customer and devs

## assignment 4
* know the different types of arrows in UML diagrams
* remember the Bicycle components class diagram
* know all the different types of diagrams
  * state chart
  * use case
  * class diagram
  * sequence diagram

## assignment 5
* know the design patterns (not going to have to write code)
  * singleton pattern was _almost_ featured as a code question
  * might have something on the Observer pattern
* advantages/differences between interfaces and superclasses
* Dependency Injection (mock assets, like a DB to be used for testing)

## assignment 6
* why might a strategy pattern be chosen over a factory pattern when they could accomplish the same thing
* should you run down a list of Design Patterns when you are trying to find a solution to a problem?

## assignment 7
* what's more important.. an SRS or an SDD?
  * would most likely be the SRS
  * justify your answer
* what is the motivation behind an SDD? Who consumes it?

## assignment 8
* when should the testing process begin, and why???
* why is unit testing important?
* why can testing only detect the presence of errors, and not their absence?
* negative testing is important... edge cases
* devs should be involved in testing (w/ unit tests, automated integration tests)

## assignment 9
* why is it such a challenge to accurately test app performance
  * what sort of apps might be easier to test this way?
* when is pen testing so important? when would be the best time to run this test?

## assignment 10
* TDD stuff (advantage & disadvantages)
* code coverage: measured by line/function/file <-- _def one of these questions_
