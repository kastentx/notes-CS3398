# Auth/Admin

## How to get rid of 'admin' routes and replace with Auth
* we don't want just anyone to be able to access 'admin' features
  * like delete, add driver, etc
* username/password can be easily sent in the header
  * should use https or other encryption so this doesn't get stolen/intercepted

## OAUTH 2
* uses existing identification provider services like facebook or google

## Cookies and Sessions
* sessions can send back a unique ID (session token) that keeps auth alive for a period of time

## Data Mining
* trying to get something of value out of a bunch of data
* then, analyze it to learn something meaningful

## Applied Analytics
* lots of new fields/jobs are opening up

* reminder: how to implement authentication
  * first choice:
  * `npm install --save basic-auth`
  * second choice:
    * `npm install --save expresss-basic-auth`
      * this should make adding authentication easy
