# Waterfall Method 

## Requirements Phase
* dedicated to gathering/analysis of problem's requirements
* Deliverable is the `Software Requirements Specification`
  * like a contract with the client

## Design Phase
* dedicated to high level design of the software to be coded
* typically done by a senior engineer or architect
* involves modeling tools like UML and understanding of Design Patterns
* Deliverable is the `Software Design Document` (SDD)

## Code Phase
* devs implement the design specified in the SDD
* also includes Unit Testing
* Deliverable is the `Executable Binary`

## Integration and Testing Phase
* involves Testers and QA people
* does _not_ include Unit Tests
* many testing methods to handle this phase
* Deliverables of this phase:
  * `The Test Plan`
  * `Test scripts`
  * `Test Data`
  * `Test Results`
  * Defects..

### V & V
#### Verification
* Did I make the thing right?
#### Validation
* Did I make the right thing?

## Maintenance Phase
* involves support, sustainment activities
* may include new features as requested by the customer
* Deliverable is a happy customer!

## End of Life Phase
* involves lots of communication and some plan to move customers over to a newer system
* missing this step can lead to unhappy customers

## Downsides to Waterfall method...
* used frequently until the 2000s
* can lead to blown budgets and schedules
* still worth learning though, because:
  * still used by many govt entities
  * first major process used to solve the problem of software development
  * provides a good baseline for comparing other methods

# Other types of Models

## Incremental Model
* a basis for Agile methods
* the goal is to reduce the pain felt when bugs or changes are found
* delivery in small bites is often good for most customers
* uses _Rapid Application Development_ AKA Prototyping
* **Downsides:**
  * hard to measure progress
  * as software matures, its often necessary to refactor (increasing technical debt)

## Integration and Configuration
* focuses on code reuse
* may involve frameworks or libraries
* may involve a commercial "off the shelf" product
* reduces software development effort
* **Downsides:**
  * doesn't work well for small projects
  * customer requirements less stringent
  * maintenance and refactoring becomes a problem

# Prototyping
* `Prototype` - _a rapidly produced, functionally and qualitatively deficient product intended to improve the dialog between a developer and a customer._
## Upsides to Prototyping
* this is a **tool**, not a process
* an effective way to communicate a potential design and understanding of requirements to a customer
* can be used to explore the value of a new proposed functionality before too much effort is spent
* helps drive a solid understanding of requirements to the design and dev team
* heavily valued by User Experience engineers
## Downsides to Prototyping
* can still be time consuming if the right prototyping tools/languages are not used
* othen leads to unrealistic expectations from the customer

# CMMi
* Software Engineering Institute's **Capability Maturity Model (integrated)**
* used as a measure of process maturity
* the ultimate goal is **continuous improvement**

##### Assignment 2 - Lady Ada Lovelace questions

# Team Project 1: "A Game of Chess"
* 5 person teams
* implement a chess game
* can use any language/libraries
* need to have an **SRS**, **SDD**, full tests (plan+results) and team analysis
* AI can be anything.. even random
  * minimax algorithm is a good suggestion
* needs to be able to accept some form of user input
* must begin from normal starting position and end with checkmate
* all changes and work should be done through GitHub

## Grading Notes
* 20 pts possible for each section
  * 16 pts given for each phase for meeting minimum requirements
  * 1 extra pt given for each additional requirement
### Report
* **SRS** - capturing the functional requirements
  * minimum requirements + any extra that we add
  * professor is the 'customer'
  * expect about 5 to 10 pages
* **SDD** - detailing the high to mid-level design of system
  * use UML when applicable
  * capture enough detail to show that you have analyzed how the system should be built
  * prof _should_ be able to code the project based off this document alone
  * _Design Patterns_ should be used
  * will be a long document (pictures too) 5 to 30 pages
* **Unit Tests**
  * implement some unit tests.. don't have to do all of them
  * focus on testing algorithms, not objects
* **Test Plan/Results**
  * high-level test plan must be written and results presented
  * capture at least 2 defects
    * they don't need to be fixed unless they are really critical
* **Team Results Analysis**
  * team driven analysis (2 to 3 pages)
  * submitted as a team
  * talk about challenges, disgreements encountered

# Chapter 4 - Requirements

### Why Gather Requirements?
* provide scope and boundaries
* provide a baseline for validation
* serves as a contract between customer and developer

## User Requirements
* Statements and diagrams that describe what the end users want to accomplish and how they will accomplish it using your application. High level requirements that define the goal the user wants to achieve.
* **shall** is a good word to use in these...
  * examples:
    * _The Mentcare system shall generate monthly management reports showing the cost of drugs prescribed by each clinic during that month_
    * _The Windows Task Manager shall provide information about each running process._
    * _The Instant Book feature shall allow the traveler to book a rental property immediately._

## System Requirements
* Detailed requirements that describe what the system will do to achieve a goal.
  * examples:
    * _On the last day of each month MentCare shall generate a summary of the drugs prescribed, cost, and prescribing doctor._
    * _The Task Manager shall provide a grid within a dialog that shows the CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, and GPU usage taken._
    * _If the Owner has configured Instant Book for their property, the Book It Now feature shall automatically accept the booking._

## Functional Requirements
* How the system should behave
  * _If the drugs are available in different dose units, MentCare shall create a seperate report for each dose unit._
  * _If the user clicks the CPU column header, the Task Manager shall sort the processes by CPU usage._

## Non-Functional Requirements
* Constraints or properties given to the system.
  * _Mentcare shall restrict access to drug cost reports to authorized users._
  * _The Task Manager shall update every 1000ms._
  * _The Book It Now feature shall be implemented as a stand alone JavaScript service._

## Requirements Elicitation
* an iterative and highly communicative process
* mental model of the system held by customer may be very different than what is possible
* requires a deep understanding of the business processes (domain knowledge)
* interviews by product managers, program managers, and/or business analysts to capture requirements
* Ethnography is one way to utilize employees with limited domain knowledge
  * involves observational analysis of organizational and business behaviors

### User Stories and Scenarios
* a way of capturing interaction or "flow" between user and system
* an easy and effective method of capturing functional requirements

### Use Cases
* NOT user stories
* UML defined diagram that outlines the different user types and their potential interactions with the system

## The Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
* serves as the contract between a customer and developers
* the level of detail is usually negotiated, but ambiguity can lead to problems later on
* document serves as a baseline for the test plan and customer acceptance
* takes a long time to build

# Lady Ada
* daughter of Lord Byron (famous poet)
* was tutored in Math and Science after her father's death
* met Charles Babbage when she was 17
* realized that computers could be used to realize differing algorithms
* created encoding for letters and symbols, loops
* Ada language (1979) named after Ada Lovelace
