# Software Design
* Why spend time designing?
  * easier to change an approach before its implemented.
  * easier to communicate high-level design than code.
  * easier to think about patterns with designs than coe.
  * improves scalability and maintainability.

## Design Modeling Tools
* tools needed to describe system designs in natural language
  * minimize errors, ambiguity, differing interpretations

## Universal Modeling Language
* there are many types of UML models
### Structure Diagrams
* Class Diagrams - show object classes in a system as well as relationships, properties, methods
  * associations and relationships shown with different types of arrows
    * inheritance/generalization (is a)
    * composition (has a)
    * aggregation (has a)
    * multiplicity (1..*)
      * nothing is _assumed_ so put 1 if you know there is only 1
  * structure shows class fields (especially public)
    * private stuff thats needed for implementation not required to be listed
  * operations:
    * \+ public
    * \- private
    * \# protected
    * \~ package
  * responsibility not often used... provides a description
### Behavior Diagrams
* Use Case Diagrams - show interaction between system and environment
  * used especially during the requirements phase
  * stick figures, lines connecting to actions user can take
* Sequence Diagrams - looking at behavior of components and the order they execute/react
  * facebook auth example
* State Machine Diagrams - looking at the state of the system

## Assignment 3 Questions

## Sample Interview Questions (UML)
### write Class Diagram for a bicycle
* fields for things like color
* classes for things like Chain, Gears, Wheels
  * composition arrows for "has a" relationship
* create a Vehicle interface
  * implement this with an abstract Cycle class
    * Cycle class has wheels, etc.
    * bicycle, motorcycle, etc. extend the Cycle class
### homeAway login system (Sequence Diagram example)
* shows request, authentication...
* user redirected to presentation
* page goes back to user
* arrows are read from top to bottom
