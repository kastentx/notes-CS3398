# SRS Reviews
* make sure to use \<game name\> _shall_, and not must, will, etc
* don't say "_the user_ shall..."

# Agile Methods
* releases are performed at the end of each **Sprint**
  * Sprint **Ceremonies** take the place of SRS and SDD
  * features (called **User Stories**) are released to Production env
* Daily **Scrum** meetings improve inter-team communication

## User Stories
* sets of requirements from the end user perspective.
* usually a "vertical slice" of an application
* can be implemented/released within one sprint
* "As a chess player, I want to be able to select a spot on the board so that I can move a chess piece."
  * has 4 components:
  * **Description**: more detailed version of a user story
  * **Acceptance** Criteria: maps to test plan.. lists items that must work to be considered complete
  * **Size**: a unit of complexity (given in a pseudo-fibonaci fashion)
  * **Precedence**: determined by the product owner

## Sprint
* usually 1 to 3 weeks.. trend is moving shorter
* **Sprint Velocity**: measure of sprint size, in terms of "user story points"
* **Burndown**: an internal measure of progress in each sprint
* **Sprint Board**: used to track progress of each user story during the sprint
* **Sprint Ceremonies**: include scrum, planning, grooming, retrospective, and demo/review

### Sprint Stakeholders
* should follow the "2 pizza" rule
* Position include:
  * **product owner**: individual who represents the product (or customer)
  * **developers**: devs who execute development tasks
  * **scrum master**: individual who facilitates sprint ceremonies and helps to remove blockers
  * **scribe**:  responsible for documenting activities, updating stories and tasks (can be S.M.)
  * **qa (trending away)**: a smaller team of QA members responsible for quality tasks

### Backlog
* prioritized stack of User Stories
* stories created and ordered by Product Owner

### Burndown
* as stories are moved to "Done" state, the number of story points remaining decreases

#### Definition of "Done"
* a story cannot be considered "Done" until it meets the criteria of **Definition of Done**
  * code is complete
  * code has been peer reviewed
  * ...has been unit tested

### Scrum Master
* daily _short_ meeting
* status updates given by stakeholders include:
  * what they worked on yesterday
  * what they are working on today
  * what, if anything, is blocking their work
* after scrum is a "parking lot" meeting where other announcements may be given

### Sprint Grooming
* have acceptance criteria updated
* have tasks written to accomplish acceptance criteria

### Sprint Planning
* similar to sprint grooming, but stories should be ready to accept and meet the **definition of ready**
* a new sprint is created
* at the end, team commits to the sprint
* **Fist of Five**: everyone on the team votes (from 1-5) on how confident they are about the sprint

### Sprint Review
* typically includes stakeholders _outside_ the core team
* can include customers
* each completed story is explained and demonstrated
* after review is complete, release can be performed
