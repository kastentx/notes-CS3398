# Lecture Notes

## Server Oriented Architecture
* SOA implies the the overall system is implemented by tiers/networks of services.
* SaaS implies that the client accesses software by calling a service.
  * only refers to the architecture between the user and the product
* services allow for a different billing model
  * pay-per-use, instead of a single up-front license fee (great for scaling)
* because of loose coupling between services, implementations can be changed on demand at any tier
* Interfaces are critical for successful SOA

## XML vs. JSON
* data has to flow between the client and the server
* these two formats are the most widely used:
* **XML** uses angle brackets ("<" ">") and looks like HTML
* **JSON** uses curcly braces ("{" "}") and looks like JavaScript Objects with key/value pairs

## SOAP
* Simple Object Access Protocol
* allows client/service communication over HTTP/TCP/UDP and other protocols
* uses XML format to send data
* "Web Service Definition Language" (WSDL) describes the request and response methods
  * has 3 parts:
    * What
    * How
    * Where
* allows you to communicate between apps written in different languages
* messages are sent directly. no bus (procedure based)

## RESTFUL interfaces
* REST builds upon HTTP requests

### HTTP Request
* uses verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
* has a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
  * usually the address, URL, or IP address
  * can include built-in query parameters
* has the HTTP Version (1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
* includes "headers" (list of key-value pairs)
* some verbs need a request "body"
* `GET` is useful because it contains parameters in the URL
  * this is good for sending someone a specific link
  * very bad for security - don't put passwords in the URL
* `POST` uses a body to send data
  * needs to include the "content type" (can be JSON)
  * data is sent in the specified format
  * can be encrypted for better security
* `PUT` is used as a combination of GET/POST
  * the URL identifies the item to be updated
  * the PUT body contains the new value for that item
  * replaces the existing item entirely
    * to modify only part of an existing item, use `PATCH`
* `DELETE`
  * like GET, does not need a body

### HTTP Response
* has the following parts:
  * status/response code (200, 404, 500, etc)
  * HTTP version
  * response headers
  * response body

## What REST does
* leverages HTTP verbs to allow procedural, but stateless requests on objects.
* doesn't need access to a complex WSDL to make requests
  * request and response payloads are often represented as JSON
* RESTful APIs can also maintain their versioning via the URL

## Idempotency
* if you make the same response, you should get the same response
  * as long as the data on the back-end hasn't changed

# Project 2
* end product will be kinda like the Tesla API we saw in class
* UI won't be required (maybe extra credit)
* will need to implement GET, POST, DELETEs
* Doing the project in Java will be a huge pain (but is allowed)
  * tons of external tools and libraries needed to get it to work
* Link posted by prof contains an easy beginner tutorial for Node.js
* he said using serverless architecture would be ok too
