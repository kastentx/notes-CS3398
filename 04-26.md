# final review

## assignment 1
* what a software engineer really does
  * not _just_ about writing code
  * need to communicate and work with a team, etc
* application types: 
  * real time
  * embedded
  * transactional (web-site.. request/response)

## assignment 2
* waterfall related stuff
  * what it is
  * know the phases
  * draw the diagram
  * what are the tradeoffs with using waterfall
    * when is it appropriate to use? not to use?
    * why is becoming less popular
* verification / validation
* capability maturity model (5 levels)

## assignment 3
* functional vs. non-functional requirements
* user vs. system requirements

## assignment 4
* UML diagrams
* aggregation vs. composition vs. inheritence
* "bicycle question" with inheritence/interfaces
* state machine vs. sequence diagram
* use case diagram (stick figures and circles)
* class diagram <- super critical to understand

## assignment 5
* design patterns
  * singleton
  * factory _pattern_
  * abstract factory
  * dependency injection
* inheritence vs. interfaces
* look at the design pattern example code

## assignment 6
* more design patterns
  * observer pattern
  * strategy
* realize that the patterns are all pretty similar..
  * strength is in _how_ they are being used
* should you run down a list of patterns?
  * no... not exactly sure why 

## assignment 7
* SDD

## assignment 8
* testing
* unit testing
  * done by developers
* QA team does different types of tests:
  * white box
  * black box
  * smoke test
  * monkey testing
  * integration testing / system testing
* TDD - test driven development

## assignment 9
* more testing
  * what is pen testing
  * what is monkey testing
* this chapter was more dev-ops related than SW Eng

## assignment 10
* TDD
* example code _should_ be up on tracs

## assignment 11
* Agile vs. Waterfall
  * agile delivers things sooner
  * trades documentation for team communication
* 2 pizza rule - teams should be small enough to be fed on 2 pizzas
* devs prefer agile because you can write code sooner and less documentation

## assignment 12
* gitflow
* working with teams/merging code
* pair programming

## assignment 13
* what is rpc?
* what is message based?
  * kafka

## assignment 15
* SOA vs SOAP vs SaaS
* XML vs JSON
* what are advantages of SOAP over REST? disadvantages?
* what are the 3 parts to WSDL file?
* why does RESTful build on HTTP? (standardization)
* what are the parts of the HTTP Request and Response?
  * body
  * status code
  * version
  * etc...

## assignment 16
* how does Kanban differ from Scrum?
  * good for working through backlogs of stuff.. not focused on delivering in sprints
* product owner vs product manager
  * owner is a scrum role - represents the customer
    * owns what the product will be
  * PM is someone hired by the compant to manage the process
* sizing user stories
  * done so you can estimate what can get done during a sprint

## assignment 17
* differnece between GET and POST
* having a database (mongoDB) helps store data

## assignment 18
* product manager
* product owner
* project manager - tries to estimate how long whole project will take
* product owner+manager are the same sometimes, sometimes not
* is having a product owner helpful?

## assignment 19
* what is considered a Threat? an Asset? Vulnerability?
* social engineering? why is it so effective?
  * people make mistakes
  * use education to mitigate this risk
* what can u prevent with defensive programming?
  * sql injection
  * cross site scripting
* IT handles virus protection and DDoS prevention
* CEO is ultimately responsible for the organization's security

## assignment 20
* different types of attacks

## assignment 21
* auth & auth
  * authentication is any time you require a password (proof that they are who they say the are)
  * authorization is when you need to check if someone has permission for something
* OAUTH 2 leverages known, trusted ID-servies
* data is valuable

## assignment 22
* project managers vs product managers
* scrum master should NOT be project manager
  * becuase you don't want Project Manager to see intenral team stats, speed, etc
* estimation is hard
  * getting better at it is important
  * mistakes are expensive
* engineering manager is a boss
  * its important to be able to work/get along with them!

## assignment 23
* seperate the UI and the backend application

## assignment 24
* different architectural patterns
* understand that arch design needs to be up front
  * very expensive to refactor this kind of stuff
  * uses an informal UML class diagram kind of thing
* logical view.. physical view.. who would want to see each one of these?
