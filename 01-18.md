# Class Notes

## Software Engineer vs. Programmer
* **Software Engineering** is the set of processes used to design, create, test, deploy, and deliver, upgrade, maintain and scale software
  * builds a _deliverable product_ with quality, etc.

## Types of Software
* 8 types listed in the book on p. 11
  * stand-alone
    * ex: native app on a smartphone
    * challenges:
      * performance
      * legacy hardware support
      * patches/security
  * interactive transaction-based
  * embedded control systems
    * real-time stuff.. like medical equipment/sensors
    * challenges:
      * real-time performance
      * safety concerns
      * security concerns
      * hardware limits
  * batch processsing systems
  * entertainment systems
  * modeling and simulation sustems
  * data collection and analysis
  * systems of systems
    * challenges:
      * disparate environments
      * communication challenges
      * synchronization
      * end to end latency
      * failovers
      * polyglot applications and databases

## Internet (and Enterprise) Software Engineering
* 100's of millions of users
* B2B transactions
* APIs, SLAs, contracts, etc
* The "Cloud"
* Asynchronous technologies
  * AJAX, multithreading, multi-instance apps
* Communicating between apps/systems
  * http, xml, json, encoding, encryption
* Data mining, analytics, security, authentication, scalability, etc.

## Ethics
* Different types of apps can reveal different ethical concerns
* Ethics in a professional environment
* Working with others... (tabs vs. spaces)
* Government regulations

### Assignment 1 - Charles Babbage
* 1791 - 1811
* English Mathemetician
* Sickly as a child, graduated from Cambridge
* Designed mechanical Difference Engines
* Second prototype actually built 1991
* Analytical Engine used hole punch cards

# Lecture 2

## Software Development Process
* _a series of steps that you can repeat_
* Important because:
  * code complexity increases each year
  * ever-increasing needs of the customer
  * proactive vs. reactive costs
  * continuous improvement
  * predictability

### Four Fundamental Activities
* Software Specification
* Software Development
* Software Validation
* Software Evolution
* _different software development processes may run these activities in different order, in parallel, or more than once

### Software Development Lifecycle
* **Process Model:** an abstract representation of process.
  * waterfall
    * documentation done up front
    * the goal is to understand each phase completely before moving to the next
    * heavily used by military, govt
    * **requirements phase**
      * dedicated to gathering and analyzing problem requirements
      * often involves customers directly
      * deliverable is the Software Requirements Specification
    * **design phase**
      * dedicated to the high level design of the software to be coded
      * typically done by senior engineer or architect
      * involves modeling tools and understanding of design patterns
      * deliverable is the Software Design Document
    * **code phase**
      * devs implement the design specified in the SDD
      * also includes Unit Testing
      * deliverable is the Executable Binary
    * **integration and testing phase**
      * involves testers and QA people
      * does not include Unit Tests (which are tied directly to code)
      * myriad of testing methods to handle this phase
      * Deliverable of this phase:
        * the test plan
        * test scripts
        * test data
        * test results
        * defects?
    * **V & V**
      * `verification` - did I make the thing right?
      * `validation` - did I make the right thing?
    * **maintenance phase**
      * this phase involves support, and sustainment activities
      * may include new features as requested by the customer
      * Deliverable is a happy customer/manager
    * **end of life phase**
      * not usually described as part of the waterfall model, it is usually very important to understand when and how to offboard customers and end of life as a product
      * this phase usually involves lots of communication... _not finished_
    * **downsides to waterfall method**
      * was used frequently until 2000s
      * endless recursion through eacch phase often leads to blown budgets/schedules
      * why learn it still?
        * used by govt.
        * first major process model to be used to solve the problem of creating software
        * provides and excellent baseline for comparing new models and strategies
  * incremental development (agile)
  * integration/configuration
  * prototyping
  * spiral model
