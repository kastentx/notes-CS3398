  * builds a _deliverable product_ with quality, etc.

## Types of Software
* 8 types listed in the book on p. 11
  * stand-alone
    * ex: native app on a smartphone
    * challenges:
      * performance
      * legacy hardware support
      * patches/security
  * interactive transaction-based
  * embedded control systems
    * real-time stuff.. like medical equipment/sensors
    * challenges:
      * real-time performance
      * safety concerns
      * security concerns
      * hardware limits
  * batch processsing systems
  * entertainment systems
  * modeling and simulation sustems
  * data collection and analysis
  * systems of systems
    * challenges:
      * disparate environments
      * communication challenges
      * synchronization
      * end to end latency
      * failovers
      * polyglot applications and databases

## Internet (and Enterprise) Software Engineering
* 100's of millions of users
* B2B transactions
* APIs, SLAs, contracts, etc
* The "Cloud"
* Asynchronous technologies
  * AJAX, multithreading, multi-instance apps
* Communicating between apps/systems
  * http, xml, json, encoding, encryption
* Data mining, analytics, security, authentication, scalability, etc.

## Ethics
