# Agile Methods for Project 2
* 3 phases a new team will go through:
  * **Forming:** team gets to know each other
  * **Storming:** conflict may begin to surface
  * **Norming:** differences are resolved and everyone's strengths appreciated
* Scrum ceremonies help teams reach the "norming" phase quickly
* Agile defines specfic roles for each member

## Scrum Team Roles
* Product Manager
* Scrum Master
* Developer/Delivery Team
* QA/Test

# Developing User Stories
* product manager/owner responsible for creating User Stories
* typically created as a feature from an End-User perspective
  * _"As a 'some_type_of_user', I want to 'some_feature' so that I can 'do_something'."_
* DON'T write these from a technical perspective
  * "technical debt" stories are allowed in cases where refactoring is needed, but no business value added

## Types of User Stories
* General user story
  * as defined previously
* Epic user story
  * very large feature
  * gets broken up into smaller stories
  * can span multiple sprints
* Tech Debt story
  * improves the code quality, but doesn't add new features
  * used for refactoring
* Spike
  * represents time needed for research
  * should be "time-boxed" AKA time-limit set so it doesn't continue forever
* Kaizen
  * designed to help improve processes

## How to Work on User Stories
* stories created by a PM or non-dev person won't reflect the implementation details
* developers break the stories down into tasks (AKA subtasks)
  * subtasks should take less than 8 hours
  * are typically technical
  * can usually be performed in parallel to allow the devs to "swarm" on a story

## Sizing a Story
* done during sprint planning and grooming
* based on complexity, not time
* story size is relative to other stories the team has worked on
* pick one or two stories to use as a baseline, other stories get sized comparatively
  * typically uses a modified Fibonacci scheme
    * 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100
    * use relative measurements, not cardinal

### Value of Story Points
* Story Points are for estimation and internal planning only
* don't compare with another team, because their grading scale might be different
* focus on improvement over time rather than initial accuracy
* by breaking project features into bite sized chunks that are deliverable, recovery from mistakes is _much_ less expensive
* stories are delivered early, so they tend to have some of the benefits of prototyping without all of the downsides

#### But what about...???
* many teams complain that planning ahead of time just doesn't work for them
  * this is rarely (but sometimes) a justifiable complaint
    * think about bug-fixing teams
  * there are ways to keep some of the meetings and structure from Agile in this chase

### KANBAN
* developed by japanese auto-manufacturers (toyota)
  * allowed them to inventory parts based on need, not based on supply
* the "pull" method of supply required a better system of planning
* this minimizes the amount of "in process" work and reduces context-switching

#### KANBAN Boards
* sticky notes or digital cards put into column-like sections
  * To-Do
  * In Progress
  * Done
* helps by visualizing the process
* lets team members focus on tasks that are good for them

## Why Use Agile?
* reacts to changing requirements well (much better than in Waterfall)
* focuses on communication at all times and catching mistakes early
  * cost of errors is drastically reduced
* doesn't preclude the need for documentation, but it does minimize it in many places

# Project 2
* we will do 2 sprints of 2 weeks
  * each tuesday -> sprint planning
    * will start in class but will continue outside of class
  * ~15-20 mins for stand-up each class
* tools will be recommended to us for using agile methods
* teams will sit together in class
* retrospectives will be at the end of each other Thursday
* User Stories are important!!
  * we will be graded on their format and quality.
